We believe the future of on-chain activity will be driven by autonomous agents capable of navigating complex dApp ecosystems, making informed decisions, and interacting directly with Ethereum smart contracts. Glider embodies this vision by enabling AI agents to autonomously operate Web3 front-ends through secure browser automation—executing tasks like trading, staking, bridging, or minting, all with user-signed, non-custodial wallet access.

Why We’re a Strong Fit:

Tooling & Infrastructure: Glider is a novel AI-agent framework powered by headless browser automation, secure wallet relaying, and a modular architecture that can scale across dApps. It works locally and in the cloud, forming a composable toolkit for AI-driven Web3 workflows.

Agentic System with TEE: By running inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), the agent guarantees secure, verifiable execution—enabling trusted agent collaboration and on-chain integration without risking user keys or data.

Knowledge Sharing & Workflow Builder: Through the Recall Network, agents record their thinking cycles—including prompt interpretation, visual analysis, and next-action planning—making them transparent and reusable. Users can seamlessly drag and drop past agent experiences into new workflows, enabling a collaborative multi-agent system that continually evolves and improves with each execution.
